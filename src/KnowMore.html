        Introduction
My name is Nirajan Joshi. I work as a software developer, helping businesses present themselves professionally online and make it easier for customers to reach and trust them.

The problem
Today, most customers search online before choosing a service. If a business is not clearly visible or does not look trustworthy online, customers usually choose someone else—even if the service is good.

The solution
A website works like a digital office for your business. It shows who you are, what services you provide, where you are located, and how customers can contact or book your service—without needing repeated explanations.

Why a website helps your business
Builds trust with new customers


Makes your business look modern and professional


Saves time—customers get information without calling or messaging


Easy to share like a digital visiting card


Helps customers find you on the internet



Main features I provide
One responsive website that works on mobile and computer


A booking or inquiry form where messages come directly to you
A WhatsApp button so customers can contact you instantly


Google Maps link showing your exact location


Image gallery to show your business or services


About Us section to explain your story, staff, and values



How booking works (simple explanation)
A customer can see your website, book the service online, and you receive the message of the service that the customer wants immediately. When the customer arrives, payment and access can be handled directly at your counter.

Your responsibility & my responsibility
As a developer, my responsibility is to design a website that is clean, trustworthy, and easy to use.
 The business’s responsibility is to provide correct and honest information so customers feel safe and confident.
